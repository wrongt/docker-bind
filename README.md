# Bind9 Docker Image

## Description

This docker image provides a [bind service](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/) based on [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/).

## Usage

Option to start Bind container.

### Docker Run

Use this docker command to run the bind container.
```
docker run -d --name bind --publish 53:53/udp \
--restart=always wrongt/bind:latest
```

### Docker Environment Variables

It's possible to change some variables like the uid/gid of the technical bind user/group or the executed named command. Just pass the variables via docker command to the container or define them in the docker-compose file.


#### User-ID / GroupID

Example of overwrite of the uid/gid.
```
NAMED_UID=666
NAMED_GID=666
```

or via docker-compose file:
```
    environment:
    - NAMED_UID=666
    - NAMED_GID=666
```

The default ids in the alpine bind package are:
```
UID=1000
GID=101
```

#### Named Command

It's also possible to add some additional `named` command options. Just overwrite the following variable:
```
COMMAND_OPTIONS=<option>
```

For example if you like to write all logs to the stoud, then change the variable `COMMAND` like this:
```
COMMAND_OPTIONS=-g
```


## Bind Stuff

### Bind Configuration

To pass your configuration directory with all configs and files, you've to mount the volume into the docker container with the docker option:
```
-v <bindconfig>:/etc/bind
```

Please verify, that the owner of the files is set equal to the uid/gid of the named user/group in the container.
```
chown 1000:101 <bindconfig>/*
```

## Bind Logfiles

To log the bind logs on your docker host, just mount a directory into the docker container:
```
-v <logdir>:/var/log/named
```

Please verify, that the owner of the files is set equal to the uid/gid of the named user/group in the container.
```
chown 1000:101 <bindconfig>/*
```

## Bind Sample Configuration

A working bind configuration is provided in the [git repo](https://github.com/pstauffer/docker-bind/tree/master/bindconfig).
Just mount this example folder into the docker container and you're bind should work.

## Bind Test

You can test the dns responses with `dig` or `nslookup` on the docker host.
```
dig webmail.example.com @localhost

nslookup webmail.example.com localhost
```
